# ADM HW1

 [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


Welcome to my first ADM homework repository!

In the project's root you'll find a **scripts.py** file containing all exercises scripts.

As requested, exercises are divided by the sequent structure:
```python
# First Exercise_Name (Ex: Hello, World!)

# script
print("Hello, World!")

# Second Exercise_Name

# ...and so on
```   

A **PDF Printout** of all submissions can be found inside the [**/stamps** directory](https://github.com/S4b3/ADM-HW1/tree/main/stamps).
